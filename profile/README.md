# Welcome to the Create Go App project

‚ú® Create a new production-ready project with backend (Golang), frontend (JavaScript, TypeScript) and deploy automation (Ansible, Docker) by running one CLI command. Focus on writing code and thinking of business-logic! The CLI will take care of the rest.

> Project originally developed at the end of 2019 by [Vic Sh√≥stak] (_who still works today_).
