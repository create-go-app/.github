# Contributing to Create Go App project

_TL;DR: sign up for notifications of GitHub Issues and Discussions in main repositories, be [courteous](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), follow the steps below to set up a development environment; if you stick around and contribute, you can join the team (write about yourself to us at [vic@shostak.dev]) and get commit access._

## Welcome

We invite you to join our team! Everyone is welcome to contribute code
via pull requests, to help people asking for help on issues, or in GitHub
Discussions, to help triage, reproduce, or fix bugs that people have
filed, to add to our documentation, or to help out in any other way.

We grant commit access (which includes full rights to the issue
database, such as being able to edit labels) to people who have gained
our trust and demonstrated a commitment to Create Go App project.

We communicate primarily over GitHub and email ([vic@shostak.dev]).

## Helping out in the issue database

If you want to help us triage, you are very welcome to do so!

1. Sign up for notifications of new Issues and Discussions in this
   organization's main public repositories: [cli], [fiber-go-template],
   [net_http-go-template].

2. Read [our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which stipulates
   explicitly that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional.
   If you're helping out with triage, you are representing the Create Go
   App project team, and so you want to make sure to make a good
   impression!

3. Once you've been doing this for a while, someone will invite you to
   the `create-go-app-contributors` team on GitHub and you'll be able to
   add labels too.
